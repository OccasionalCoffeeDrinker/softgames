## Demos

### Task 1 — Ace of Shadows

144 cards distributed across 6 stacks in a 3×2 grid. Every second one card is picked from a random non-empty stack and animated in a smooth parabolic arc to a random destination stack. An `isMoving` guard prevents the same card from being grabbed twice mid-flight.

Card faces are rendered as real playing cards (suit symbol + value, corner indicators top-left and bottom-right, pip layout for 2–10, face-card label for J/Q/K, oversized symbol for A). All 144 faces are baked into a single `RenderTexture` atlas (12 × 12 grid) incrementally — 12 cells per frame inside `update()` — to avoid rAF budget violations. A "Preparing cards…" overlay is shown during baking; card movement is gated until the atlas is complete.

- **144 cards**, 24 per stack at start
- **1 s** trigger interval, **2 s** arc animation (ease-in-out)
- Live moves counter
- Single-atlas rendering — all 144 sprites share one `RenderTexture`, so Pixi batches them into one draw call
- Ticker runs at native display refresh rate (no `maxFPS` cap)

### Task 2 — Magic Words

Fetches a dialogue from the Softgames API and renders it as an animated chat feed. Each message is a `BubbleView` containing an avatar and an inline-layouted text + emoji line (word-wrapped).

- Real API call with `AbortController` timeout guard
- Custom `tokenize()` splits `"Hello {emoji}"` into text/emoji tokens
- Unknown emoji tokens (e.g. `{win}`, `{affirmative}`) are auto-fetched from DiceBear as a fallback; unresolvable tokens render as `[name]`
- Inline word-wrap layout engine
- Avatar images loaded via native `Image` → `Texture.from()` (works with extensionless URLs from DiceBear)
- Auto-scroll with staggered reveal (1.5 s between messages)

### Task 3 — Phoenix Flame

Additive-blend particle fire effect built on a hard-capped pool of 10 sprites. Particles use pre-computed lookup tables (LUT) for alpha and scale curves, keeping per-frame math to a minimum.

- **10 particle cap** via `ParticlePool`
- `blendMode = 'add'` (PixiJS v8 string form)
- Fire colour gradient white → yellow → orange → red
- Sine-wave horizontal sway; spawn rate driven by `AppConfig`

## Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a full breakdown of the scene lifecycle, asset ownership model, and tween system.

Design decisions and trade-offs are documented in [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md).

## Testing

```
src/
├── core/utils/math.test.ts                              (21 tests)
├── features/ace-of-shadows/models/CardStackModel.test.ts (11 tests)
├── features/magic-words/tokenizer.test.ts               (10 tests)
└── features/phoenix-flame/ParticlePool.test.ts           ( 7 tests)
                                                   Total: 49 tests
```

All tests run in the `node` environment (pure-logic modules — no DOM required).

## Deployment

The `ci.yml` workflow runs on every push to `main`:

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm run test -- --run`
4. `npm run build`
5. Deploy `dist/` to GitHub Pages

To activate deployment, enable **Pages** in your repository settings and set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (or `Actions` if using the workflow's `actions/deploy-pages` step).
